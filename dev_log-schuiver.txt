08/02/2026
- Resolved problems with state checks (Congratulations printing continuously, tiles 
    could be move after solved)
- added 2 overlay buttons when SOLVED: QUIT & PLAY AGAIN
- added SOLVED! in big font and red when SOLVED
- added hover with brighter colours for the quit and play again buttons

07/02/2026
- program wasn't working correctly so reverted to previous commit (mechanics working
    but lots of print statements)
- remarked the print statements out but left them in
- switched from variable check is True (running, scrambling, solved), to state check 
    (PLAYING, SOLVED, QUITTING)

06/02/2026
- found an image and refactored it to 600x600 pixels
- loaded image into program
- sliced image in 9 pieces representing tiles (rectangles, surfaces)
- adapted code to clicking on arrow keys makes the empty slot move visually (+debug)
- wrote mouse code so clicking on neighbouring tiles of empty slot makes the empty
    slot move both visually and conceptually (+ extensive debug with help of chatGPT)
    Don't fully understand everything about surfaces, rectangles and delta yet
- moved "solved condition fulfilled" loop outside of key detection so both arrow 
    keys and mouse clicks can result in solved board congratulations message
- removed superfluous print statements and optimized code according to chatGPT's
    directions

02/02/2026
- added a scramble function
- debugged it with lots of print statements
- isolated the repeated "move the empty slot in a direction" code into a move() function
- debugged that, it took a while

01/02/2026
- added a get_possible_slides(empty_slot) function that calculates the legal move 
    directions of the empty_slot
- detect arrow keypresses and compare them with the allowed moves
- updating the play board when legal moves happen (= swap the empty space with the 
    tile that moved)
!!! I am actually moving the empty slot around whereas when one plays it, we move  
    tiles, but the swapping the moving tile for the empty space is identical
    Might this cause logic problems when I am implementing the mouse clicks
    instead of the arrow keys?

31/01/2026
- installed uv on distrobox (see main dev_log.txt)
- uv python install 3.12.2 
- made project structure with root/src/schuiver/__init__.py, /__main__.py, 
    /app.py en root/assets
- moved content of main.py to app.py
- initiated uv for the project: uv init
- locked project on python 3.12.2 with .python-version file
- made and activated venv: 
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
- added to pyproject.toml:
    [build-system]
    requires = ["hatchling"]
    build-backend = "hatchling.build"
- pinned the new python version: uv python pin 3.14 (auto-updated .python-version to 3.14.2)
- deactivated, then removed the venv: rm -rf .venv
- recreated venv with the new python version:uv venv --python 3.14.2 (auto-downloaded it)
- uv sync
- manually edited pyproject.toml to require python 3.14.2
- installed pygame-ce 2.5.6: uv add "pygame-ce==2.5.6", which auto-updated pyproject.toml
    and uv.lock
- nieuwe commit met structuur, lock enz.
- worked on app.py to have a minimalistic gameloop (display black screen 600*600
    and wait for user input: linker muisknop of exit registration)
- added comments to all the code parts
- added/solved Exception handling
- started working on logic (solved_board, empty_slot, how to calculate allowed moves)

30/01/2026
- created project root folder on toad: 
    /var/home/toad/boxhome/nikisavantes/projects/schuiver
- initiated git at project root: git init
- made empty repo on github with standard gitignore
- connected the local (remote) and the github (origin):
    git remote add origin https://github.com/nikisavantes/schuiver.git
- renamed master to main: git branch -M main
- pulled gitignore: git pull origin main
- (eerst of na pull?) initial commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin main
